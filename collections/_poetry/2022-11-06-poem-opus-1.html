    I often lay flat on the bed, under the ruffled comforter, the window open, the various sounds of the night filing in, the moonlight following right behind and bathing me in its aching midnight blue; during these times, <i>she</i> always tends to ponder: <i>what are you feeling right now?</i>
        I dont know would be the general response, if some unknown lips were to ask me, but <i>her</i> whole essence was all so well beknown to me, so I try my best to answer:
        I am feeling nothing. The world is like a bud bathing in the rays of dawn that has not quite yet burst. I wake up to play flash games on Kongregate, I sleep to my dad on the brink of tears, croaking for the pains of those who played in the Vietnam war while Paint it Black chimes in the background. My favorite song is Titanium. It sounds nice. 
        I am feeling conflicted. The bud has just started blooming and sees only the vastness of the skies filled with <i>nuages gris</i>. I go to school and do well, A's in most classes. I don't care too much, school is just a smudge on the wooden plank floating in space. Mom isn't with dad anymore, but that doesn't matter to me. I have hobbies to fill the time, they don't really matter to me. I don't have friends, but there is no one but myself to blame. I don't need friends. They wouldn't really matter to me. Maybe I can create an animation to <i>Once Again</i>; that would be neat. That would be too hard, though. On second thought, I won't. 
        I am feeling empty. The bud has awoken and has grown conscious, screaming in tritones. I drink a breakfast cappuccino at a local cafe as gentle alternative plays, talking to somebody about something, whereof I wouldn't know. It isn't real, despite my pleas to the sleeping god. <i>How To Never Stop Being Sad</i> plays through my earbuds as I stare into my food, the fish prancing contentedly in their tank in the back of the restaurant. <i>Lonely</i> plays as the blood flows like Cocytus and drops like rain from the understanding cat's etches into my forearm, the wasps still not quitting my lungs despite how many slits are there. I sit on my bed at 03:26 on a Tuesday, participating in a world of vibrant french fantasy. Calmness, content. Envy, pain. <i>I will ascend into the abyss</i>, I tell her; chains are the response. 

        I am feeling tired. The bud's death has been succeeded by a flower, a flower who has experienced everything in its lonely dimension (the only one it knows). The words of Athena have been spoken onto me, but Aphrodite is dead. I have killed her. I lay next to a female friend, watching an anime that I did not know the name of. I punch brick until my fist bleeds; I won't go to a hospital for that—Meursault still lives in my consciousness, but he has been trained like a whimpering pavlovian dog to discover fear. School is still just a smear on an insignificant plank. Living is floating in a pool of lukewarm fluid. The abyss is concealed in darkness. A supertonic is screamed, dominating, dragging me onto a path of glass; <i>whereto</i>?
        I am feeling enlightened. The flower sees a shower of meteors as it wilts and awaits. A violin and a piano play in harmony and fill my heart with notes in a saudade subdominant key. I trust her, and follow her lead, as she rolls the rock up; smiling and flowing. I play Chopin's Ballade of grief; grinning and hoping. I sit on the bus at 18:43. The sunlight's pink tint is pretty.
        I am feeling. The flower has passed, worms ceremoniously strip away its pedals. I stand over a black ocean under a black sky with Mahler's seventh symphony softly sounding in my ears. The nocturnal abyss reaches warily to brush upon my feet, but withdraws with a sense of bewilderment and betrayal in its wails. I look up at the moon, whose mellow clair de lune blankets its body over the earth. 
Aphrodite was dead from the start.
Sysiphus is happy.
To the sides of me stand <i>her</i>; one holding a bud of a magnolia, one a bud of a calla lily, one a flower of a rose, one a dead chrysanth. <i>She</i> smiles, <i>I</i> smile, despite the clock refusing to tick. The water engulfs her feet. 
        You thought she was dead, but no! She is immortal, she is wrong, bad, horrid! She is a chromatic, harmonic dissonance, but beauty comes from her, but knowledge comes from her, happiness, sadness, power come from her! Many took her limbs and transformed her into pain, into happiness, into longing, hatred, lust, sorrow; and so I do the same—come with me, join me, combine, append to the tabula and better the monster that we had prior been a part of—let us recycle the flower, let us stand over the abyss, let us live authentically, let us live peacefully, let us live free, let us experience experiences and deny the darkness.
