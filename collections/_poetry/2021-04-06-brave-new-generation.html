And on that wooden scaffold awaits
Unfinished men of helpless minds
Greeted by the arrogant gait
Of malignant monsters of various kinds
Who happed the chance to cross them.
Greed and wind, sorrow and wrath
Look down, beckon, and condemn
Those dreading to fight the man of Gath,
In the desolate desert plains of pain,
Where lies the baby, waiting to be slain,
Acutely watching with hopeful eyes,
Only to be blinded by earthly demise.
