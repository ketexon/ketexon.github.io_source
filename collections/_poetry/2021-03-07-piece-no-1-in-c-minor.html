Long in the humble sight
Of what creature of pale
Skin and brown hair 
Shoots
My heart so.

Peace of mind but scratches
Of soul: Fallen shadows and
 Escaped realities, death and 
    Love fall together
 In their sugar-laden embrace
       Pain and sorrow escape
The gunning of 
        The guards,
The ninth fading
 Ends before the 
  Creator can
   Observeâ€”
        Shifting to
 A ninth of 
                  Marches
                             To the
        Devil;
Tense chromata and 
                            Chapters
              Of prickles crash upon
    The statute of
                        Autonomy,
 And the 
                              Small steps make
                    Etches,
         Engravings,
                                     Into the stone
                              Of linguistic capability.

          Regardless,
   Your
          Presence
     Fills my being with
  Happiness,
 Peace;
Love.
