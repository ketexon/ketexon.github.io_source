title: The Chemist
---
Bitter coffee and tasteless pills
Mix like oleum and blood.
The black liquid instills
The sense of here. Drugged
      Into awareness of being,
      Nudged into seeing. 

The capsule of reform
Instills a sense of calm,
Of happiness. The storm
Is gone. The sweat of the palm
      Drips no more.

What mystical beings,
Physical in air and essence,
Can disturb my well-being,
Shorten convalescence?

      How can such trifles
      Of reality penetrate
      The gate of solipsism?

      The impenetrable gate,
      It must not be broken.

For the security of DesCartes,
For the truth of truth,
For the beauty of art,
For the wonders of youth,
      It must stay closed,
      Unopposed, unopposed.

The capsule of reform
Instills a sense of calm,
Not in me, but my form.
The dread, the qualm,
      They are <i>therein</i>.

But my mind,
My conscience,
They stay <i>behind</i>,
Outside the presence,

Of the destructive poisons.
Fire solely burns forms
Of obsolescence. 

The impenetrable gate
      Does not fall victim to despair.


And thus no purpose do they take,
The teratogens of the brain.
      Manifestations
Of arbitrary rules
Should not influence
      The rationality
Against physicality.

Quod erat amandum stat.
