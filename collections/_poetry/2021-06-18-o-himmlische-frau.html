The serpent, a tsunami, propagating
Invariantly, the illusory lips
Entrapping the fremdgesch√§mt hound
Atop the dazzling floor
       (Seligman's pride).

From it emerges a corpse, molding red,
Char-black hair and cursed eyes.
Happiness was not pursued, rather
Pleasure, passion, pleasing pain.

The night before, the veal was held.
Feathery the feeling, warm as whiskey,
In its loop of giving and return,
Nightfall is forlorn no more.

But hidden in my veins,
There lay a corpse, molding my
           Brain and spine.
Feathery the feeling
                                 of despair,
Dripping into the
                           spring-like angel.

Sacred, love is no longer.
The blood distilled, the
Hours of dusk realized in the
Hours of morn quake and
                           tremble.

The game of nocturnal birds who
Watch, on whose feathers
"Quast" is written,
And whose continuous motives
                 Nobody's given.

Weighty embraces outweigh the
Height of passion. And one can
Try to believe the mind agrees,
And one can know the will wishes.

The game is external, a wrath
Of locusts, buzz and creak,
Shiver and bleak, darken the
Shade, Sharpen the blade,

Fade off, die away.

O himmlische Frau,
Cool the sand, strengthen
Apollo. Let Artemis punish,
Let Hades swallow.

O himmlische Frau,
Warm the water,
Let Tiana give,
Let the warmth father.

O himmlische Frau,
Frau der Welt,
Komm abhanden mir nicht,
Erstirb niemals,

Ich flehe dich an.
