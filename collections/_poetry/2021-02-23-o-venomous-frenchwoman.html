Slews of joyful arid venom
Entice me to mull with lust
Over confessions to the plenum,
The guards of her heart's trust.

And I pense in the days, sing the notes
That I scribed with the portrait of the mortal
Girl in my eyes, the girl of the lips with motes
Of honey, whose touch brings closer the portal

Of sunny hope: hope to feel contact
Beyond that of primitive rays of light.
And the zephyr from her eyes, with tact
And power, brings darkness to the mite

Of chance, the maybe, more so
The dignity of etre. The plight
Of the king, Icarus' wings flow
Down his arms, subject to blight.

Dare I presume the similarity of thought?
Nay, to cost the loss of normal ways
Greater than pitiful ardor is folly, I ought
To defy advice and for her simply gaze.

Though authenticity may rise
And surpass the irrationality
Of presuming prediction lies
In light of the prolixity of reality. 

But shall I cede to desire
The power to control the mind,
Or shall I enter its fire
And to the world become blind?

Ah the answer is deceased,
With the birth of amorality!
Fire of hope, winds of the east,
And foggy rains of impartiality,

Torture me no more.
It is love that I implore.
