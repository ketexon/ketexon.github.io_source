The dark.

Delicacy of the heart
The response gave,
But the words meant
Nothing,
For the state of the matter
Is the same as it was
The other day.

This Delicacy I have
Unconsciously longed for
Since that indifferent day
Of unknown car rides.
The delicacy that I 
Had stripped for necessity
Of productivity.

But it tingles,
It awakens,
It brings new Chemicals
That replace the old
Ones that never became,
Ones that were never going
To become.

Apologize not.
You have brought
An equal joy
Of experience,
Of this insecure defense
Of complacent metaphors
And conjoined roots
And pretty notes.

The light.

Pathetically embraced reform,
Battery of the self.
It's not like
Any of it matters in the
Grand scheme of things,
He consoled. 

And he is right.
Naught has changed,
Functions derive,
Series converge,
People walk
And breathe and speak
And masturbate and lie
And murder and die.
Who is to care for
Opsitotic minds.

The feeling of
Equality shifts. For I am above.
Not You, not Them, but All.
Not in Quality, not in
Anything of the Body,
But Power. Metaphysical. 
My sole Console,
My sole Latch,
Brings me the power
To be Delicate
And proceed to
Rest atop the pyramidal Horse
With Content
And Sadness.
