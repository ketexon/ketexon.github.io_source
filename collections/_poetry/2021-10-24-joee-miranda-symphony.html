Nothing is real
Nothing is real
Comfort me
In your soft shoes

Pedal to the mud
And break laws
Kiss her, kiss her
I don't want sex

Semen tastes so good
Hard, hard hugs
Castrate, castrate, castrate
Cleaver and cutting board

I notice a subconscious fear
It hurts to say
I don't want to put it

And I won't unredacted
But it's probably true
And I hate myself.

I don't fix it
And that makes me
hate myself more.

Sleep steals away resolution
And replaces it with a fa√ßade
I feel fine, refreshed, calm
Lavender simmers beneath

Nostalgia hurts more
A hugged one abandoned
I am paralyzed, and sleep will
Rinse you away, away

Observe differently, observe
Deeper, observe the feeling
Inside your chest that makes you
Feel that you need a hug.

Write all the things you
Tell yourself to relax
I'm going to die, pain
is helpful,

A bullet is all it takes
Nothing is real
Observe, observe, observe

Happiness is limited,
Don't expect to get more than
A drop.

Pain is helpful,
Observe differently.
Indifference is the head,

And the heart,
The earth, and blood.

I guess I'll try to be happy,
I don't know what makes
me happy.

Serve, serve, serve

Confined,
Bound, gagged,

Please do not
Leave the path.

Now is not a good time.
Forget it
Tomorrow.
Write a note in your journal

To observe
