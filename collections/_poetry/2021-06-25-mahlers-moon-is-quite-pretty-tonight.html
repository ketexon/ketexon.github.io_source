title: Mahler's Moon is quite pretty Tonight

In the clair de lune passing through
The sky's tainted window,
A laugh wets the ground,
A whimper stills the air.

The communal delicacy
In its imperious schedule,
Pings, pangs, and echos down,
Plinking across the ribs.

The bareness held close
The eyes of the bear.
The three symphonic sacrifices
Could be made with crumbling honor.

The conductor draws
And the air shakes;
The line cut shorter,
Retied, rekindled.

But silence! Self-fulfillment
Is a copper pebble
To your diamond scab
Atop the pyramid.
