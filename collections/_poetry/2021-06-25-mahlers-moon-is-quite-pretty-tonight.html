In the clair de lune passing through
The sky's tainted window,
A laugh wets the ground
And a whimper stills the air.

The communal delicacy
In its imperious schedule,
Pings, pangs, and echos down,
Sinking through the ribs.

The bareness held close
The eyes of the bear.
The three symphonic sacrifices
Could be made with crumbling honor. 

The conductor draws
And the air shakes;
The line cut shorter,
Retied, rekindled.

Self-fulfillment
Is a copper pebble
To your diamond scab
Atop the pyramid. 

But Mahler sings his songs
To the braid's dance,
Tears unknownst
To the painting's white strokes.

Mahler's moon
Is quite pretty tonight,
Fixed across the sky,
Observing indifferently.
