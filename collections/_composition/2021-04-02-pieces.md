      This piece comes with a poem:
      <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
      <pre>Long in the humble sight
      Of what creature of pale
      Skin and brown hair 
      Shoots
      My heart so.
      </pre>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
      <pre>
      Peace of mind but scratches
      Of soul: Fallen shadows and
      Escaped realities, death and 
          Love fall together
      In their sugar-laden embrace.
          Pain and sorrow escape
      The gunning of 
              The guards,
      The ninth fading
      Ends before the 
      Creator can
      Observeâ€”
              Shifting to
      A ninth of 
                      Marches
                                  To the
              Devil;
      </pre>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
      <pre>
      Tense chromata and 
                                  Chapters
                    Of prickles crash upon
          The statute of
                              Autonomy,
      And the 
                                    Small steps make
                          Etches,
              Engravings,
                                          Into the stone
                                    Of linguistic capability.

                Regardless,
        Your
                Presence
          Fills my being with
        Happiness,
      Peace;
      Love.
